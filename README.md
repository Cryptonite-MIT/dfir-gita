# Cryptonite Forensics Training Resources aka DFIR Gita

Cryptonite is the official CTF team of MIT Manipal currently ranked #3 across India.

The forensics domain is focused on incident response, network traffic analysis, steganography and malware analysis for CTFs and practical incident response. This repository is a living resource list for trainees: tools, reference material, and CTF challenges grouped by domain.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a work in progress, check back periodically for updates and additions.

The domain covers three main areas:
- Steganography and file structures
- Network and PCAP/Log analysis
- Digital forensics and incident response

Every section will have a list of required information and a list of challenges, some with file links, that will teach you how most Forensics challenges in CTFs operate.

## TODO

- [ ] fix all .zip drive links
- [ ] add all challenge files, some are missing
- [ ] add scripts to finish text steganography easily
- [ ] custom challenges
- [ ] malware resource
- [ ] add all nite chals

# Networking / PCAP / Log Analysis

A sub part of the DFIR domain. Focuses on networking and traffic analysis to analyze transmission of information across networks.

## Core tools, libraries and their use

- Wireshark (GUI)
- tshark (CLI)
- tcpdump
- scapy
- pyshark

- tcpdump
  - Capture: `tcpdump -i eth0 -w capture.pcap`
  - Filtered capture: `tcpdump -i eth0 port 80 -w http.pcap`
  - Read: `tcpdump -r capture.pcap`

- tshark
  - Extract fields: `tshark -r capture.pcap -T fields -e ip.src -e ip.dst`
  - Live capture to file: `tshark -i eth0 -f "tcp and port 80" -w out.pcap`

- scapy (Python)
  - Read pcap: `pkts = rdpcap("capture.pcap")`
  - Send packet: `send(IP(dst="1.2.3.4")/TCP()/b"data")`

- pyshark
  - Iterate: `cap = pyshark.FileCapture("capture.pcap"); for pkt in cap: print(pkt)`

PCAP vs PCAPNG:

- pcap: simple libpcap format, per-packet headers, widely supported.
- pcapng: richer metadata, per-interface blocks, comments, better timestamps.

Tool differences (short):

- wireshark: GUI analyzer, deep dissectors, follow TCP stream, visualizations.
- tcpdump: capture/filter CLI tool, lightweight.
- scapy: Python packet crafting/manipulation and analysis library.
- tshark: CLI Wireshark for batch processing and field extraction.

# Digital Forensics and Incident Response

DFIR covers disk and memory forensics, timeline reconstruction, registry analysis, artifact extraction, and incident reporting.

## Core tools and frameworks

- Volatility 2
- Volatility 3
- Autopsy/Sleuth Kit
- FTK Imager
- LiME (memory acquisition for Linux)
- Sysinternals suite (Windows)

## Volatility 2 vs Volatility 3

- Volatility 3 is Python 3 native; Volatility 2 historically used Python 2.
- Plugin architectures differ, many plugins reworked in v3.
- v3 has updated parsers and active development, v2 has many mature community plugins and writeups.
- Performance and cross-platform improvements exist in v3, but some v2 plugins may not have direct equivalents.

Memlabs:

- Repo: https://github.com/stuxnet999/MemLabs
- Used by bi0s as part of their DFIR training, great starter resource.
- **Volatility 2 recommended to solve.**

  Questions:

  1. Access Granted!

  > First things first. MogamBro is so dumb that he might be using the same set of passwords everywhere, so lets try cracking his PC's password for some luck.

  2. 0.69 Day:

  > MogamBro was using some really old piece of software for his daily tasks. What a noob! Doesn't he know that using these deprecated versions of the same leaves him vulnerable towards various attacks! Sure he faced the consequences through those spam mails.

  3. MogamBro's Guilty Pleasure:

  > MogamBro was spammed with a lot of emails, he was able to evade some but fell for some of them due to his greed. Can you analyze the emails & figure out how he got scammed, not once but twice!

  4. I'm wired in:

  > MogamBro got scared after knowing that his PC has been hacked and tried to type a SOS message to his friend through his 'keyboard'. Can you find the contents of that message, obviously the attacker was logging him!

  5. Bypassing Transport Layer:

  > The exploit not only manipulated MogamBro's secret but also tried to establish an external TCP connection to gain further access to the machine. But I don't really think he was able to do so. Can you figure out where the exploit was trying to reach to?

  6. Lottery:

  > Now that you know the CVE, figure out how the attacker crafted the payload & executed it to compromise the 'secret'.

  - **schmerz-2:** _What was the first shell command attacker executed?_
  - **schmerz-3:** _What was the value of key attacker used to encrypt the data?_
  - **schmerz-4:** _What were the contents of the secret file? (flag is the sha256sum of the file inside the zip)_
